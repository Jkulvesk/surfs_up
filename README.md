# SurfsUp Weather Analysis for June and December

## Overview
We wanted to see if the surf and icecream business would be sustainable year round so we are looking at the weather for the months of June and December. 

## Results
- For both months, there were enough data points to be confident in the results - over 1500 measurment datapoints for both months.
- Temperature ranges are fairly steady for both months with the standard deviation between 3 and 4 degrees. 
- Temperature ranges for December are slightly lower than in June with the December mean at almost 4 degrees lower than June. See tables below.

## Summary
While the temperature results point to a sustainable business year round, I would want to add additional datapoints to be certain. Temperatures can feel different when there is lack of sun, presence of rain or high winds. I recommend querying humidity/precipitation, and wind conditions to be sure the business will be sustainable year round. I would also recommend doing this for all months to determine if there are multiple months where conditions are poor or just one or two months.

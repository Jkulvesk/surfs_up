# SurfsUp Weather Analysis for June and December

## Overview
We wanted to see if the surf and ice cream business would be sustainable year round so we are looking at the weather for the months of June and December. 

## Results
- For both months, there were enough data points to be confident in the results - over 1500 measurment datapoints for both months.
- Temperature ranges are fairly steady for both months with the standard deviation between 3 and 4 degrees. 
- Temperature ranges for December are slightly lower than in June with the December mean at almost 4 degrees lower than June. See tables below.

## Summary
While the temperature results point to a sustainable business year round, I would want to add additional datapoints to be certain. Temperatures can feel different when there is lack of sun, presence of rain or high winds. I recommend querying humidity/precipitation, and wind conditions to be sure the business will be sustainable year round. I would also recommend doing this for all months to determine if there are multiple months where conditions are poor or just one or two months.

In running queries for the precipitation for June and December, it looks like there are mostly clear days. June may have a few days of heavy rain according to the max values as seen below.
